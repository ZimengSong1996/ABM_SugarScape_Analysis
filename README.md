### What Influence the Wealth Inequality in Sugarscape Model: Exploring the Effects of Initial Wealth, Metabolism, Vision and Intergenerational reset

This is my individual programe from UCL CASA (Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis), focusing on Sugarscape 3 and 2, this investigation examines how individual parameters, specifically initial wealth, metabolism, and vision, affect wealth inequality in the Sugarscape model. By modifying these parameters, we record their impacts on the Gini index (Gini 1912), which measures wealth inequality, and in Model 3, we also consider the proportion of young agents in the top 20% wealth group to gauge intergenerational wealth gaps. Next, the comparison of both models will reveal the role of intergenerational reset mechanisms in wealth distribution. Consequently, the research question is: how initial wealth, metabolism, vision and intergenrational reset incluence the wealth inequality in Sugarscape model?
